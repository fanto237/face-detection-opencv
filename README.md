# Face Recognition Opencv

## About
This project is for the thesis of the end of my studies. It is about developing a web application for users to load and images, and they will then receive all faces contained in these images. The IA Face detection Service used in the backend is called [*****OpenCv*****](https://opencv.org/). 
Since all almost all companies are moving from monolithic applications to microservices, I decided to build the whole backend using a microservice architecture to learn more about this topic, since it is taking more and more market shares. I decided to pick an Events Driven Architecture for my backend services to communicate and used [*****RabbitMq*****](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) as Events Broker and [*****Masstransit*****](https://masstransit-project.com/) as Service bus.

## Technologies
-  ``React Js`` : I decided to choose React from all others' frontend JavaScript framework because it is one of the most popular and used one. It has a lot of advantages compare to the other JS Framework. Many companies such as Netflix, Facebook, Ubers etc... adopted it nowadays.

-  ``ASP .Net Core`` : It is the .dotnet framework for building robust Rest Web Services such as Rest API. Based on 2022 GitHub survey, Asp .net ranked 2 (behind React by the ways) in the top of the most liked framework, due to its simplicity and speed.

- ``Open Cv`` : Computer vision library for processing image and performing the face detection.
