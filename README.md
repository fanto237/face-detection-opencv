# face-recognize-opencv

## about
this project is for the thesis of the end of my studies. It is about developing a web application for users to load and images and they will then received all faces contained in this images. The IA Face detection Service used in the backend is called **OpenCv**. 
Since all almost all compagnies are moving from monolythics applications to microservices, I decided to build the whole backend using a microservice architectur to learn more about this topic, since it is taking more and more marketshares. I decided to pick and **Events Driven Architecturs** for my backend Services to communicate and used **RabbitMq** as Events Broker and **Masstransit** as Servicebus.
