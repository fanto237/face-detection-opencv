# Face Recognition Opencv

## About
this project is for the thesis of the end of my studies. It is about developing a web application for users to load and images and they will then received all faces contained in this images. The IA Face detection Service used in the backend is called [*****OpenCv*****](https://opencv.org/).
Since all almost all compagnies are moving from monolythics applications to microservices, I decided to build the whole backend using a microservice architectur to learn more about this topic, since it is taking more and more marketshares. I decided to pick and **Events Driven Architecturs** for my backend Services to communicate and used [*****RabbitMq*****](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) as Events Broker and [*****Masstransit*****](https://masstransit-project.com/) as Servicebus.

## Technologies
-  ***React Js*** : I decided to choose react js from all others frontend javascript framework because it is one of the most popular and used one. It has a lot of advantages compare too the other Js Framework. Many compangies such as Nextflix, Facebook, Ubers etc... adopted it nowadays.

-  ***ASP .Net Core Web API*** : It is the .dotnet framework for building robust Rest based Api. Based on 2022 github survey Asp .net ranked 2 ( behind React Js by the ways ) in the top of the most liked framework, due to its simplicity and speed.

- ***Open Cv*** : last but no least open cv one of the most popular open source computor vision tools for the face recognition.
